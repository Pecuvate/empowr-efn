          What is the Empowr Freelancer Network?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-mid leading-relaxed mb-8">
          The Empowr Freelancer Network (EFN) is a community of self-employed professionals working with Empowr CIC on a flexible, freelance basis. Members take on assignments across a range of roles — from coaching and facilitation to production and operations — depending on their skills and availability.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-black mb-4">Roles Available</h3>
        <RolesTable />
        <p className="text-sm text-mid italic mt-4 mb-10">
          Rates are reviewed periodically. Your agreed rate will be confirmed in writing as part
          of your onboarding.

          What Is the Self-Billing Arrangement?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-mid leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Under a self-billing arrangement, Empowr CIC generates invoices on your behalf once
          your timesheet is approved. You do not need to send us an invoice — we handle it for
          you.
        </p>
        <p className="text-mid leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This is agreed in your Freelance Services Agreement and is fully compliant with HMRC
          guidelines (VAT Notice 700/62).
        </p>
        <Callout variant="warning">
          You must not submit your own invoice for work covered by this agreement. Doing so
          creates a duplicate and will delay your payment.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-mid leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>National Insurance number</li>

        <Callout variant="info">
          Don&apos;t have a UTR yet? You can still join — UTR is optional at the onboarding stage.
          You will need to register for Self Assessment with HMRC once you begin earning as a
          freelancer.

        <p className="text-mid leading-relaxed mb-6">
          To be included in a given month&apos;s payment run, your timesheet must be approved by
          the admin team before the monthly cut-off date. Timesheets approved after cut-off roll
          into the following month.
        </p>
        <Callout variant="info">
          The cut-off is based on the approval date, not the submission date. Submit your
          timesheet with enough time for the admin team to review it before cut-off.
        </Callout>
        <p className="text-mid leading-relaxed mt-6">
