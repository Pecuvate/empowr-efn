    question: "Do I need to send an invoice?",
    answer:
      "No. Under the self-billing arrangement in your Freelance Services Agreement, we generate invoices on your behalf. You must not submit your own invoice.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where do I log my hours?",
    answer:
      "In Sling. Your manager will walk you through this when your profile is set up.",
  },

    question: "When will I be paid?",
    answer:
      "On the last Friday of each calendar month, provided your timesheet was approved before the cut-off date.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my hours look wrong on the approval email?",
    answer:
      "Reply immediately. Once the invoice is raised it is harder to amend. Do not wait.",
  },
  {
    question: "I haven't received my payment — what do I do?",
    answer:
      "Wait at least 2 working days from the payment date. If it still hasn't arrived, reply to the payment confirmation email and we will investigate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need the invoice for my tax return?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The invoice emailed to you after your timesheet is approved is your record of income for HMRC self-assessment. Keep it — we will not re-issue copies after 30 days.",

    question: "Do I need to register as self-employed?",

    question: "What if I don't have a UTR?",

        You can still complete onboarding without one. Your UTR is issued when you register
